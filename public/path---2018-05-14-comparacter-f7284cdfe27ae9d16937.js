I’m pretty sure anybody that watches TV can identify with that. So, a group of three of my friends and myself built a system which, given a character from a specific movie, will return a list of other similar characters in different movies!</p>\n<p>Try it out <a href="//comparacter.herokuapp.com">here</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>The first steps in the project was to collect our data and process it in a way that was helpful to us. This resulted in us collecting a mammoth amount of data, including about 1300 different movie scripts, 25000+ movie reviews, and 5000+ lines of character and movie metadata. Of course, this would be a lot for one person, so at this point we planned out exactly what we needed to do to complete the project and divided up the work. I was in charge of movie script processing, the main part of the character similarity/comparison metrics, and the Rocchio relevance feedback update. Other portions of the project included front-end design, back-end maintenance, and the rest of the data processing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Data Processing</h2>\n<p>This was undeniably the lengthiest portion of the project. We had 3 different datasets with movie scripts in different formats, so the first job was to process them so that they were in a usable format going forward. I chose to do this by creating lists of dictionaries (HashMaps) for each movie, where each dictionary consisted of the line itself and the speaker. This allowed for easier comparison between characters and movies in the future. After this, I used Sk-learn to do some TF-IDF vectorization (7500 features) in order to start doing character similarity.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Similarity metric, NLP, and Rocchio Relevance Feedback</h2>\n<p>After processing the data, I had to figure out how to accurately compare characters to get the most similar based entirely on their words – the scripts had no indication of expression or tone. For the first demo, we just had to have a working similarity metric, so I chose to use a basic cosine similarity. However, while the results were acceptable with this metric, they weren’t stellar. As a result, we tried to incorporate more complex NLP techniques (notably SVD) which would yield better and more consistent results. </p>\n<p>We ended up using a Stanford created NLP library called Empath to ease the process. Empath helped perform SVD and produced standardized topic/sentiment tags when given a line. What I then did was to produce a count of empath tags per character, normalized against the total tags per movie, which avoided longer movies having more tags and thus being more ‘similar’ to others. I felt that cosine similarity between these tags wouldn’t be particularly helpful, as there was a small and finite number of tags (~200). Therefore, I chose to use general Jaccard similarity to compare the traits for each character to one another.</p>\n<p>My final task was to implement Rocchio Relevance feedback. Rocchio is essentially a way of refining search queries based on some sort of user feedback about the given results. The way that we chose to do this was to display the top 10 character traits and their importance to that character (in the form of a radar chart), and allow the user to toggle certain tags’ weights in the query. </p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<h3>Big data, Algorithmic complexity: Time and Space</h3>\n<p>There were two separate sections of algorithms I had to worry about – the first, data pre-processing, comprised of one time calculations dealing with larger, non-runtime problems. The second, live query response, deals with runtime functions.</p>\n<p>This was my first experience dealing with such a large dataset (the dataset, purely comprised of text documents, was ~1GB, and the original Cosine similarity matrix was > 500MB, as it had about 128,000,000 entries). As a result, I thought that, for pre-processing, just running the first iteration of code I could think of would suffice, even if it took a little longer. Unfortunately, I ran into a road block when trying to calculate the Cosine similarity matrix – by my calculations, it would have taken about 20 straight hours of full CPU usage on my laptop. </p>\n<p>Obviously, this wasn’t a feasible process, so I had to think about another solution. Re-reading the fundamentals of what a Cos-sim matrix is, I realized that this process could be solved by simple linear algebra. By multiplying the TF-IDF matrix with the transpose of itself, then dividing by the norm matrix, I achieved the same result as calculating each individual score, but having saved 19 hours and 59 minutes. </p>\n<p>I later ran into a similar issue on the query side of things. The built-in python sort (returning highest scoring characters) resulted in around a 10 second query lookup time, which obviously was not acceptable. So I decided to, after experimentation, use quicksort. I used this over variants like merge sort because it is objectively the quickest, and being unstable is not relevant here as movies were processed in an arbitrary order in any case.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What I learned from this project</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>NLP techniques and libraries (e.g. SpaCy, Empath)</li>\n<li>Effective Algorithm design for large datasets</li>\n<li>Data pre-processing techniques</li>\n<li>Timelining, organisational, and management skills</li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{title:"Comparacter - A character based movie recommendation engine",date:"May 14, 2018"}},theImage:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:3.1372549019607843,src:"/static/2018-05-14-comparacter-393a822bc0fc3b175f1208c6b1da20bc-7a72d.png",srcSet:"/static/2018-05-14-comparacter-393a822bc0fc3b175f1208c6b1da20bc-8baea.png 158w,\n/static/2018-05-14-comparacter-393a822bc0fc3b175f1208c6b1da20bc-69705.png 315w,\n/static/2018-05-14-comparacter-393a822bc0fc3b175f1208c6b1da20bc-7a72d.png 630w,\n/static/2018-05-14-comparacter-393a822bc0fc3b175f1208c6b1da20bc-514af.png 945w,\n/static/2018-05-14-comparacter-393a822bc0fc3b175f1208c6b1da20bc-6eb3d.png 1260w,\n/static/2018-05-14-comparacter-393a822bc0fc3b175f1208c6b1da20bc-bf598.png 1890w,\n/static/2018-05-14-comparacter-393a822bc0fc3b175f1208c6b1da20bc-d5343.png 1920w",sizes:"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2018-05-14-comparacter/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/2018-04-20-Fire and Shadow/"},frontmatter:{title:"Fire & Shadow - My first video game!"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/2018-05-21-chess-AI/"},frontmatter:{title:"ChessKit - A chess playing Artifical Intelligence"}}}}}});
